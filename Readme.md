# Humble Superheroes

This repository contains a Humble Superheroes application with:

- **Backend** (Node.js, Express)
- **Frontend** (React)

It demonstrates a simple MVC architecture, validation for humility score, basic Jest tests, and a modern UI with a superhero-themed background.

## Features

### Backend
#### Endpoints:
- `POST /superheroes` to add a new hero (requires `name`, `superpower`, `humilityScore`).
- `GET /superheroes` to list heroes, sorted by descending humility score.

#### Validation:
- Humility score must be between **1 and 10**.

#### Tests:
- Basic Jest tests with **Supertest**.

### Frontend
- React form to add a new hero, automatically refreshing the list.
- Modern, card-based UI with a full-page background image.
- Responsive design and lightweight styling.

## Next Steps & Improvements
- **Database:** Switch from in-memory to a real DB (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).
- **Additional Tests:** Increase coverage with integration and unit tests.
- **Auth & Security:** Add JWT-based authentication or other security measures.
- **Deployment:** Containerize with Docker or deploy to a cloud platform.
